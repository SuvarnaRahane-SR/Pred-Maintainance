Aim :- We present a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in industry to the best of our knowledge.
       

Object :- The main object of my project is to predict when and how my system or  equipment will fail in order to take preventive measures before the actual failure occurs.The goal is to maximize system uptime and optimize maintenance schedules by proactively managing the maintenance process.

Working :-
* Predictive maintenance is the process of using predictive analytics  to determine when maintenance should be performed on a equipment before problem   occurs.
* This project helps to reduce downtime and increase efficiency.
* The project involves collecting and analysing data from Sensors,Muchines and   other Sources topredict when and what kind of maintenance should be carried   out.
* Here firstly we done the data preprocessing (data scaling,encoding and   balancing of data). 
* After that data analysis conducted by a different algorithms like  Logistic Regression,Random Forest,SVM,KNN,Bagging Classifier and Boosting Classifier     which is trained on historical data.
* For improving the accuracy of our model we done GriddSearchCV in that i give different parameters and finding best parameter which gives maximum accuracy.
  Then again build this perticular model by providing best parameter. And this is the final accuracy of our model.
* After the model is trained, it can be deployed to make predictions on new data.
